Dark Pattern Detection with BERT




This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for detecting dark patterns in text data. Dark patterns are user interface design techniques that manipulate users into making decisions that benefit the business, often at the expense of the user's interests.



Requirements

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Transformers

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn



pip install tensorflow transformers pandas matplotlib seaborn


Usage
Training the Model: The model is trained using labeled text data. The training script (train_model.py) loads the data, preprocesses it, fine-tunes the BERT model, and saves the trained model.

Predicting Dark Patterns: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict dark patterns in new text data. The script (predict_dark_patterns.py) loads the trained model, tokenizes the input text, makes predictions, and visualizes the predicted labels.

Data Visualization: The predicted labels can be visualized using different chart types. By default, the script uses a count plot to show the distribution of predicted labels. You can modify the script to use other chart types such as area charts or histograms.
